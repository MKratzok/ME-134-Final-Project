<h3> How To GitHub</h3>

This is a little run down on how to use GitHub

#### Definitions:

* Cloning a Repository - Copy shared repository to local file location (folder). Any edits within that folder will appear in GitHub Desktop. 
* Fetch Origin - Download the most up to date files in the repository __*ALWAYS DO THIS BEFORE EDITING CODE*__
* Commit to Main - Commit your changes to the repository locally 
* Push Origin - Push your commits to GitHub __*ALWAYS DO THIS AFTER EDITING CODE*__

#### Getting Started 

1) Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2) Open GitHub Desktop and clone the repository 
    * __File -> Clone Repository -> URL__
    * __Paste https://github.com/MKratzok/ME-134-Final-Project.git in *URL or username/repository* field__
    * __Select a _Local path_ for the repository to live__
    * __Press Clone__
3) Press _Fetch Origin_ in the top tool bar

Now, all of the files from the repository can be found on your hard-drive!

#### Editing Files

1) Before working on the code, *Fetch Origin*
2) Edit files as you normally would (I recommend *PyCharm Community Edition* for Python but anything works)
3) All of your edits will show up in GitHub Desktop's changed files list

If you take a break from the code, then commit your changes so that if anyone else edits the code, your modifications will not be lost. 

#### Committing Edits

1) Review the changed files to make sure it all makes sense
2) Fill in the *Summary* and *Description* fields in GitHub Desktop
3) Press *Commit to __main__*
4) Press *Push origin* in the top tool bar

Congratulations! You can now use GitHub! :)
